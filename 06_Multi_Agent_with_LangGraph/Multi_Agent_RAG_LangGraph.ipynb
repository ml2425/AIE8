Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user\\nmessages and 36% of Practical Guidance messages are requests for Tutoring or Teaching. Another\\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% of Practical Guidance - is general how-to advice on a variety\\nof topics. Technical Help includes Computer Programming (4.2% of messages), Mathematical Calcu-\\nlations (3%), and Data Analysis (0.4%).

In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates that Therapy/Companionship is\\nthe most prevalent use case for generative AI.9\\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First,\\nwe show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time,\\nand may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active\\nusers had typically masculine first names.10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025,\\nwith active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that\\nnearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps\\nhave narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively\\nfaster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and\\nusers in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work.\\nWe introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is\\nseeking, using a simple rubric that we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing.11\\nAsking is when the\\nuser is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving\\nmodels of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and\\nSchneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)). Doing is when the user wants to produce some output\\nor perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al.\\n(2003)). Expressing is when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or\\naction. We estimate that about 49% of messages are Asking, 40% are Doing, and 11% are Expressing.\\nHowever, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified as Doing (e.g., performing\\njob tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those are Writing tasks. The relative frequency of writing-\\nrelated conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all\\nwhite-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by\\nemployers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of\\ngenerative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs\\nsuch as writing and software code.\\nWe also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network\\n(O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that\\nabout 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining,\\ndocumenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems,\\nand thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage\\nare highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activities Getting\\nInformation and Making Decisions and Solving Problems are in the top five of message frequency in\\nnearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales\\noccupations.\\nOverall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT\\nuse cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is'),\n",

       " 'response': \"The provided context indicates that the average person typically uses AI, such as ChatGPT, for requests that modify user inputs rather than creating entirely new content. Education is a major use case, with significant portions of messages involving tutoring, teaching, and general how-to advice on various topics. Users also seek technical help with computer programming, mathematical calculations, and data analysis. Additionally, conversations about self-expression—covering relationships, personal reflection, games, and role play—are relatively less common. Generative AI's ability to produce written content, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products makes it flexible and useful for customized responses, information seeking, and practical guidance across different user needs.\"}"

    "\n",
    "1. Why is a \"powerful\" LLM important for this use-case?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What tasks must our Agent perform that make it such that the LLM's reasoning capability is a potential limiter?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 YOUR ANSWER HERE\n",
    "A powerful LLM is crucial because it serves as the \"brain\" of the multi-agent system, performing several critical functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Orchestration & Decision Making**: The LLM must intelligently route requests between different agents (Research team vs Response team) based on the nature of the query\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Tool Selection & Function Calling**: It needs to determine which tools/functions to invoke and when, requiring understanding of tool capabilities and context\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Quality Assessment**: The LLM acts as a judge, evaluating the quality and relevance of retrieved information before passing it to the response team\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Context Integration**: It must synthesize information from multiple sources and maintain conversation context across agent interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Error Handling**: When agents fail or produce suboptimal results, the LLM must detect this and decide on corrective actions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 YOUR ANSWER HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM's reasoning capability becomes a bottleneck for several complex tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Subjective Quality Assessment**: Evaluating whether retrieved papers are relevant, authoritative, and appropriate for the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Information Synthesis**: Combining insights from multiple papers while avoiding contradictions and maintaining coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Contextual Relevance**: Determining if retrieved information actually answers the user's specific question, not just related topics\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Bias Detection**: Identifying potential biases or limitations in the retrieved sources\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Complex Query Understanding**: Parsing ambiguous or multi-part questions that require breaking down into sub-tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Dynamic Routing**: Deciding when to switch between research and response phases based on information sufficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Error Recovery**: Recognizing when initial searches failed and determining alternative strategies\n",

    "##### ❓ Question #2:\n",
    "\n",
    "How could you make sure your Agent uses specific tools that you wish it to use? Are there any ways to concretely set a flow through tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "YOUR ANSWER HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several concrete ways to control tool usage and flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Temperature Control:**\n",
    "• Setting temperature=0 makes the LLM more deterministic and consistent\n",
    "• This helps ensure reproducible tool selection, but doesn't guarantee specific tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Tool Binding & Function Calling:**\n",
    "• Use `llm.bind_tools(tools=[specific_tool], tool_choice=\"required\")` to force specific tools\n",
    "• Set `tool_choice=\"auto\"` for automatic selection or `tool_choice=\"none\"` to disable tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. LangGraph State Management:**\n",
    "• Define explicit state transitions in the graph structure\n",
    "• Use conditional edges to control which tools/agents are called based on state\n",
    "• Implement custom routing logic in supervisor nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Prompt Engineering:**\n",
    "• Design specific prompts that guide the LLM toward desired tool usage\n",
    "• Include examples of tool usage in few-shot prompts\n",
    "• Use system messages to constrain behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Graph Structure Control:**\n",
    "• Design the LangGraph with specific nodes and edges\n",
    "• Use `add_conditional_edges()` to create deterministic flows\n",
    "• Implement custom routing functions that decide tool usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Tool Selection Logic:**\n",
    "• Create custom tool selection functions\n",
    "• Use `tool_choice` parameter to force specific tool calls\n",
    "• Implement fallback mechanisms for tool failures\n",

    "**Most Effective Approach:** Combine LangGraph's state management with explicit tool binding and conditional routing to create deterministic tool \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. LangGraph State Management + Conditional Routing:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# notebook - Research Graph\n",
    "research_graph.add_conditional_edges(\n",
    "    \"ResearchSupervisor\",\n",
    "    lambda x: x[\"next\"],  # State-based routing\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"Search\": \"Search\", \n",
    "        \"HowPeopleUseAIRetriever\": \"HowPeopleUseAIRetriever\", \n",
    "        \"FINISH\": END\n",
    "    },\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**What this does:** Uses state variable `x[\"next\"]` to deterministically route to specific tools/agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Tool Binding with Function Calling:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# From your create_team_supervisor function\n",
    "def create_team_supervisor(llm: ChatOpenAI, system_prompt, members) -> str:\n",
    "    function_def = {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"route\",\n",
    "        \"description\": \"Select the next role.\",\n",
    "        \"parameters\": {\n",
    "            \"type\": \"object\",\n",
    "            \"properties\": {\n",
    "                \"next\": {\n",
    "                    \"type\": \"string\",\n",
    "                    \"enum\": options,  # Constrains choices to specific tools\n",
    "                    \"description\": \"Role to route to next.\",\n",
    "                }\n",
    "            },\n",
    "            \"required\": [\"next\"],\n",
    "        },\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    # This binds the LLM to use ONLY the specified routing function\n",
    "    return llm.bind_tools(tools=[function_def], tool_choice=\"route\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Deterministic Flow Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Super Graph - Controls flow between teams\n",
    "super_graph.add_conditional_edges(\n",
    "    \"SuperSupervisor\",\n",
    "    lambda x: x[\"next\"],  # State determines next step\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"Response team\": \"Response team\",\n",
    "        \"Research team\": \"Research team\", \n",
    "        \"FINISH\": END\n",
    "    },\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Complete Flow Control:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# notebook shows this pattern:\n",
    "# State → Conditional Edge → Specific Tool/Agent → State Update → Next Conditional Edge\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example flow:\n",
    "# 1. State: {\"next\": \"Research team\"}\n",
    "# 2. Conditional Edge: Routes to Research team\n",
    "# 3. Research team uses specific tools (Search, HowPeopleUseAIRetriever)\n",
    "# 4. State updates: {\"next\": \"Response team\"} \n",
    "# 5. Conditional Edge: Routes to Response team\n",
    "# 6. Response team uses different tools\n",
    "# 7. State updates: {\"next\": \"FINISH\"}\n",
    "```\n",

This development stems from the necessity of providing LLMs with relevant data and structured information to increase both their efficiency and effectiveness in various applications. This report delves into what context engineering entails, recent advances, and its critical role in shaping AI interactions.\\n\\n**What is Context Engineering?**\\n\\nContext engineering can be defined as the sophisticated practice of configuring systems that can intelligently deliver appropriate context and resources to LLMs. Unlike traditional prompt engineering, where users rely on static text prompts, context engineering encompasses a more intricate approach whereby systems curate and manage contextual information dynamically. This approach enables LLMs to produce more contextually aware and accurate responses.\\n\\n**Key Developments and Techniques**\\n\\n1. **Evolving from Prompt Engineering**: The shift towards context engineering signifies a departure from simple prompt-based interactions. Developers are increasingly focusing on creating complex systems that can understand and manage the flow of information contextually, enhancing the model’s responsiveness and accuracy.\\n\\n2. **Incorporation of Memory Capabilities**: One of the notable aspects of context engineering is enabling LLMs to utilize memory features. By implementing short-term memory functionalities, LLMs can maintain the context of user interactions across multiple exchanges, resulting in seamless and more coherent dialogues.\\n\\n3. **Implementation of Advanced Frameworks**: Notable methodologies, such as the **Sentinel framework**, have been introduced to synthesize relevant context effectively while minimizing the risk of overwhelming the model with excess data. This approach is paramount to maintaining model performance.\\n\\n4. **Dynamic Context Payload Optimization**: Context payload management has become paramount within these engineering frameworks. Developers are focused on tailoring the information passed to LLMs, ensuring only the most relevant context is leveraged, which aids in adhering to operational parameters like token limitations.\\n\\n**Impact on AI Utilization**\\n\\nThe ramifications of context engineering are significant across a multitude of sectors:\\n\\n- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Contextual data enables LLMs to function effectively as decision-making aids, particularly in knowledge-heavy fields. Organizations benefit from having increased productivity as LLMs can provide contextual support that augments human decision-making skills.\\n\\n- **User Interaction Improvements**: The application of context engineering greatly enhances user experiences. With LLMs capable of recognizing and recalling context, user interactions have become more intuitive, allowing for more natural, back-and-forth conversations.\\n\\n- **Facilitating Autonomous Systems**: As context engineering progresses, LLMs are evolving into more autonomous agents, proficiently managing complex tasks without requiring incessant user engagement. This evolution extends AI's applicability in sectors such as customer support, management, and creative industries.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIn 2025, context engineering has firmly established itself as a cornerstone of modern AI development, particularly with LLMs. By mastering context engineering, developers can create sophisticated systems that lead to more efficient, intelligent, and contextually aware AI interactions. These advancements pave the way for a future where AI can operate with a higher degree of autonomy and intelligence, significantly impacting various industries and enhancing user satisfaction with AI technologies.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, name='HowPeopleUseAIRetriever')]}}\n",

    "### Report on the Rise of Context Engineering in the LLM Space in 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "As we move further into 2025, the landscape of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, particularly in the domain of large language models (LLMs). One significant trend emerging is \"context engineering,\" which has begun to outpace the earlier focus on prompt engineering. This report explores how context engineering is reshaping the dynamics of AI usage, enhancing the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex tasks, and ultimately influencing the way users interact with AI technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Emergence of Context Engineering\n",
    "In previous years, prompt engineering involved crafting inputs to guide LLMs to generate desired outputs. However, by 2025, the limitations of traditional prompt engineering have become evident, especially as applications require more dynamic interactions and multi-turn dialogues. Context engineering has emerged as a new paradigm, prioritizing the construction of strategies and systems that enable LLMs to access and utilize extensive contextual information effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LLMs, such as GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3, now boast context windows that can handle up to 1 million tokens. This substantial increase allows these models to grasp more extensive content, such as books or lengthy documents, fundamentally changing what they can achieve in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Developments in Context Engineering\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Knowledge Management**: The shift towards context engineering facilitates more sophisticated knowledge management within AI systems. These systems now use persistent memory and adaptive reasoning, enabling them to maintain context across interactions. For example, agent-based LLMs can now engage in workflows requiring multiple exchanges, which is vital for complex applications requiring follow-ups and extended dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Context Lengths**: Advances in transformer architectures have led to the possibility of extending native context lengths dramatically. As a result, LLMs can process larger datasets directly, enhancing their capacity to deliver accurate and relevant outputs without extensive re-prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Compression and Retrieval**: Techniques such as context compression, where information is stored externally or synthesized to maximize relevance, are gaining traction. Methods identified in recent studies highlight the importance of integrating efficient retrieval systems and summarization techniques to make the most of the available context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Rise of Multi-Agent Systems**: In 2025, LLM applications are increasingly shifting towards multi-agent architectures, where different AI agents work collaboratively, leveraging various tools and pieces of information to improve output accuracy and reduce operational inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact on AI Usage\n",
    "The implications of context engineering are far-reaching and transformative for users and organizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Enterprises adopting context engineering report accuracy rates of 90-95%, a significant improvement over the 65-75% typically associated with earlier methods. This rise in performance is generating more trust in AI systems across various sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Deployment and Cost Efficiency**: Organizations employing structured context engineering have demonstrated a 3x increase in the speed of bringing AI solutions to production and a 40% reduction in operational costs compared to traditional prompt-based methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptability and Scalability**: Context-engineered systems are inherently more adaptable, allowing businesses to scale AI applications rapidly in response to evolving needs without overhauling the underlying architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Augmentation of Human Intelligence**: As context engineering allows AI systems to interact in more meaningful ways, they are increasingly positioned as partners in decision-making processes, rather than mere tools. This evolution enhances the collaborative potential between humans and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The rise of context engineering marks a critical turning point in the development and application of LLMs. As AI systems become increasingly capable of managing and utilizing complex contextual information, they are set to enhance user experiences, improve efficiency, and drive new innovations across industries. Organizations that embrace this trend will likely lead the charge into a future where AI is not just a tool for automation but a collaborative partner in problem-solving and creativity."
